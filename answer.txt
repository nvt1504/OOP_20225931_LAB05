Question: The Aims class must be updated to handle any exceptions generated when the play() methods are called. What happens when you don’t update for them to catch?

Answer: If we don’t update the **Aims** class to handle exceptions from the `play()` methods:

1. Program Crash: The application will terminate immediately when an exception occurs, disrupting the user experience.
2. Flow Disruption: The program loses control and cannot proceed with other operations.
3. No Recovery: Without catching exceptions, the program cannot recover or provide alternative solutions.
