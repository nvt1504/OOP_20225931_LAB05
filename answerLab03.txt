Q3: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Answer: The title of the two objects remains unchanged after the `swap` method because Java passes object references by value, and the method only swaps local references, not the original ones.

Q4:	After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
Answer: The title of `jungleDVD` is changed because the `changeTitle` method modifies the `jungleDVD` object's state directly by calling `setTitle`, which updates the title of the same object passed to the method.
